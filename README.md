# kickstarter-nlp
In this research, I created and trained different Neural Network models (1D-CNN, DNN, LSTM, and GRU) with variant text encoding technologies and dropout rates, aiming to find the best model that could predict the possibility of successful fundraising when given the blurbs content of a Kickstarter project.
